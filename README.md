Here are the summarize steps involved 

1.The following columns were renamed as 'Date Joined', 'Valuation', 'Select Investors', and 'Funding' to 'Date', 'Valuation ($B)', 'Investors', and 'Funding ($B)' respectively.

2. The 'Investors' column is converted to a string data type using the `astype()` method.

3. The 'Date' column is converted to a datetime data type using the `pd.to_datetime()` function.

4.  The 'Valuation ($B)' column is converted to a string data type, and then the characters ',' (comma), '$' (dollar sign), and 'B' (Billion) are replaced with empty strings using the `str.replace()` method. Finally, the column is converted to a float data type using `astype('float64')`.

5. The 'Funding ($B)' column is converted to a string data type using the `astype()` method.

6. The symbols ',' (comma), '$' (dollar sign), 'B' (billion), and 'M' (million) are removed from the 'Funding ($B)' column using the `str.replace()` method.

7.The 'Unknown' values in the 'Funding ($B)' column are replaced with NaN (missing value) using the `replace()` method.

8.The 'Funding ($B)' column is converted to a float data type using the `astype()` method.

9. The 'Funding ($B)' column is converted to a string data type using the `astype()` method.

10.The 'Funding ($B)' column is checked for values containing 'M' (million) using the `str.contains()` method. If a value contains 'M', it is replaced by removing 'M' and converting the result to a float data type, divided by 1000 using the '//' (floor division) operator. If a value does not contain 'M', 'B' (billion) is removed, and the result is converted to a float data type.

11.  NaN values in the 'Funding ($B)' column are replaced with 0 using the `fillna()` method. Then, the column is converted to an integer data type using `astype('int64')`.
12.I encountered a challenge regarding the conversion of Funding from string to integer as it contain $ sign as well as Millions to Billions.
